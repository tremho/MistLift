# MistLift

_CLI tools and structured project support for easy-access cloud development_

MistLift, aka [@tremho/mist-lift at npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tremho/mist-lift) is an OpenSource project aimed at providing an easy and seamless platform for developers
to quickly develop cloud services locally and then migrating to cloud with a simple and
lightweight Command Line API that avoids some of the more intimidating aspects of 
using larger frameworks for such purposes.

This provides a much lower barrier to entry to would-be cloud developers
and encourages a more open, distributed set of architectural choices from the 
very beginnings of a new project.

The initial version of MistLift is complete with minimal viability 
to represent its future potential.  It focuses on a Typescript (JavaScript) oriented
NodeJS stack hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud infrastructure.

In the future, other stacks will be supported, including DotNet and Python, and
other stacks supported by AWS.
Other cloud hosts, such as Azure, are also planned to be supported in future versions.

## Contributions Needed

MistLift is fully functional now, but there is much more planned in the
vision roadmap, and your help is needed!
