# MistLift Governance statement

MistLift is an open source project.  Contribution and collaboration is encouraged.

The primary governance model is the [BDFL model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)
that is common to most small opensource projects.
This model may change in the future as the community grows, but for the foreseeable
future, project founder Steve Ohmert (steve@ohmert.com) reserves the final say on 
any feature or vision updates that affect the project.

There is a small executive oversight committee, consisting of three individuals:

- Steve Ohmert (steve@ohmert.com)
- Paul Boyes (paul@pauljboyes.com)
- Rich Williams (sierrastars@gmail.com)

These other principals help guide the overall vision of the project and are authorized to make decisions 
affecting the project in the event that Mr. Ohmert is not available.

As the project grows, interested individual contributors may be called upon to
exercise their judgement on feature branch approvals and merges and for other
tasks.  To express interest in such a role, please reach out to one of the individuals
above.
